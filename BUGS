BUGS

Seriously, use a real interpreter like Frotz if you're playing
anything other than a classic Infocom game.

o Timed input is not (yet?) implemented

o Apple OS X terminal woes:
  Copy a termcap file (see http://catb.org/~esr/terminfo/) to
  /etc/termcap to get the termcap-based interface to work (I don't know
  why Apple doesn't install this file on their systems).  Also, try
  setting your TERM variable to "xterm" rather than "vt100".

o I don't think the sonar scope in Seastalker will work (this is the
  only version 3 game that splits the screen).  I'd appreciate a
  savegame made just before using it so I can try it.

o ReadLine support:
   - doesn't work with preloaded line input.
   - virulently incompatible with Curses module.
   - Not sure if there's anything I can do about these.

Apple OS X:
===========
Copy a termcap file (see http://catb.org/~esr/terminfo/) to
/etc/termcap to get the termcap-based interface to work (I don't know
why Apple doesn't install this file on their systems).  Also, try
setting your TERM variable to "xterm" rather than "vt100".

General
=======
Several obscure opcodes are not implemented.

Timed input is not implemented.

Seriously, use a real interpreter like Frotz if you're playing
anything other than a classic Infocom game.
